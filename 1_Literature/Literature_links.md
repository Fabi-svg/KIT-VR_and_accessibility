## What is the literature chapter of scientific paper?

The literature review chapter of a scientific paper is a critical component that provides an overview and evaluation of the existing body of knowledge and research on the topic being investigated. It serves several purposes, including:

- Contextualizing the research: The literature review establishes the background and context for the study. It outlines the current state of knowledge, highlights key theories, concepts, and previous research related to the research question or problem being addressed.

- Identifying research gaps: By reviewing existing literature, researchers can identify gaps or unanswered questions in the field. These gaps serve as the motivation for the current study and justify its relevance.

- Evaluating existing research: The literature review critically examines and evaluates previous studies. Researchers assess the methodologies used, the strengths and limitations of previous findings, and any conflicting or contradictory results. This evaluation helps establish the need for further research and informs the approach taken in the current study.

- Establishing theoretical framework: The literature review often involves the identification and discussion of relevant theories or conceptual frameworks that underpin the current research. This provides a theoretical foundation for the study and helps guide the research design and analysis.

- Supporting research hypotheses or objectives: The literature review connects the existing knowledge to the specific research hypotheses or objectives of the current study. It provides evidence and rationale for the research questions and hypotheses proposed by the researchers.

- Citing relevant studies: The literature review chapter includes extensive citations of previous studies, which helps to acknowledge the work of other researchers, demonstrate the researchers' familiarity with the field, and provide readers with resources for further exploration.

In summary, the literature review chapter of a scientific paper is a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of relevant research and scholarly works that contextualizes the study, identifies research gaps, and supports the rationale for the current research.

## How to write the literature chapter of scientific paper?

Writing the literature review chapter of a scientific paper involves several key steps. Here is a general guide on how to approach this section:

- Identify the scope and purpose: Determine the specific focus and purpose of your literature review. Clearly define the research question or problem you are addressing and the objectives of the review.

- Conduct a comprehensive literature search: Begin by conducting a systematic search for relevant scholarly articles, books, conference papers, and other reliable sources. Utilize academic databases, search engines, and reference lists of relevant papers to gather a wide range of sources. Keep track of the sources you find, including the author(s), title, publication year, and key findings or main points.

- Evaluate and select sources: Evaluate the quality and relevance of each source. Consider factors such as the credibility of the author and the publication, the methodology used in the study, and the relevance of the findings to your research question. Select the most significant and reputable sources that contribute to the understanding of your topic.

- Organize the literature: Group the selected sources into thematic categories or subtopics based on their similarities or relationships. This organization helps you present a logical flow of information and highlight the main themes or concepts emerging from the literature.

- Summarize and synthesize the literature: Begin writing concise summaries of the main findings, arguments, or key points from each source. Focus on the aspects that are most relevant to your research question. Look for commonalities, patterns, and trends across the literature and synthesize the information to form a coherent narrative.

- Critically analyze the literature: Evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the studies you reviewed. Identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or unresolved issues in the existing literature. Critically assess the methodology, sample size, data analysis, and other relevant aspects of the studies to determine their reliability and validity.

- Structure the literature review chapter: Organize your literature review in a clear and logical manner. Start with an introduction that sets the context and provides an overview of the topic. Then, present the main themes or subtopics you identified, providing a summary and synthesis of the literature within each theme. Use topic sentences and clear transitions to guide the reader through the review.

- Include citations and references: Properly cite all the sources you have used within the literature review chapter. Follow the appropriate citation style guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) specified by your target journal or academic institution. Make sure to create a comprehensive reference list at the end of the chapter, listing all the sources cited.

- Revise and refine: Once you have completed a draft of the literature review chapter, review and revise it for clarity, coherence, and logical flow. Ensure that your arguments and conclusions are supported by the evidence presented in the literature. Seek feedback from peers, mentors, or supervisors to improve the quality of your review.

Remember that the literature review is not merely a summary of existing research but a critical analysis that highlights the significance of your research and the gaps you aim to fill. It should demonstrate your understanding of the field and establish the rationale for your study.

### Architectural Barriers to Persons With Disabilities in Businesses in an Urban Community

#### Abstract
It is the purpose of this study to determine the frequency of architectural barriers to persons with disabilities in businesses in a small urban community in central Virginia. The survey was conducted by a trained volunteer using a one-page checklist. Only 27% of the businesses had no architectural barriers to individuals with disabilities. The most common architectural barrier for individuals with disabilities was the interference with parking and entrance into the business (65%). Faced with these architectural barriers, all individuals are encouraged to identify the architectural barriers in businesses and to file letters of complaints to the Department of Justice requesting their removal.

### Architectural Barriers: a Perspective on Progress

#### Abstract
Over the past twenty-five years, laws have been enacted mandating that buildings be designed and constructed to be accessible to persons with handicaps. The implementation of these laws with barrier-free design standards, which also developed in this period, has led to significant process in the involvement of disabled persons in the fabric of American society. Accessible design is currently in an age of implementation. It is apparently on a projected course where "handicapped design" will' ultimately be so fully integrated into the
creative process that it will be part of "universal design" in which architects and designers maximize the number of users and their experiences in a facility.

### The perspective of children and youth: How different stakeholders identify architectural barriers for inclusion in schools

#### Abstract
Recent inclusive policies are promoting the involvement of individuals with disabilities in identifying barriers that limit their full participation and inclusion in public spaces. The present two studies explored the contributions provided by different stakeholder groups in the identification of architectural barriers in elementary and secondary schools. In each school, the principal, special education resource teacher and a student independently identified architectural barriers using an observational walkthrough method. The first study consisted of 29 schools where the student evaluator had a physical disability and the second study consisted of 22 schools where the student evaluator did not have a disability. The results of both studies showed that students identified the greatest number of barriers and principals the least. The type and location of identified barriers are explored and the conclusions are examined in relation to person-environment congruence. The results highlight the efficacy of youth involvement and provide support for collaborative assessments that equitably involve all stakeholders in inclusive environmental assessments.

### Beyond Architectural Barriers: Building a Bridge Between Disability and Universal Design

#### Abstract
The paper is focused on the evolution of the concept of accessibility, by considering data of the World Health Organization (WHO) and of the Istat (Italian statistical institute). From these data it emerges that the population (worldwide and in Italy) dealing with disability represents an important share of the total. These disabilities are linked not only with disease, but also with other situation due to age, size, language, culture, job, etc. For this reason, this paper analyses how the way of seeing and dealing disability is changed over time, starting from the Italian Standard evolution. Then the action of the WHO is analyzed. The two WHO focus points are: i) disability is a health condition in an unfavorable environment; ii) disability is not a problem of a minority group within a community, but an experience that everyone, in their lifetime, can experience. All of these analyses underlined the importance of the environment influence on life of every person. Finally, the concept of Universal design UD is investigated, highlighting the importance of recognizing and understanding that human beings will have different steps in their abilities throughout their life. The originality of this research is the shifting of the attention also to people normally served by poor services, such as people of small stature, the elderly, pregnant women, parents with children in strollers, people who speak different languages and more.

### Raising Awareness about Accessibility

#### Abstract
Every citizen has to right to move throughout a city safely and independently. The term accessibility refers this right in built environment mostly for public uses. In the beginning of 20th century, accessibility started from a restricted application but nowadays it became more comprehensive due to a better understanding of physical barriers in the world. According to a recent research, designers are not aware of how architectural barriers restrict accessibility for different users. It should not be forgotten that accessibility for everyone will increase the whole citizens’ quality of life. Thus, the paper tries to show importance of raising awareness in design studios for better implementing accessibility for all people. In our urban design studio, a strong relationship has been found between accessible design solutions and students’ awareness about physical barriers. The paper concludes that there is an immediate need to elaborate design courses with universal design principles.

### Wheelchair accessibility to public buildings in Istanbul

#### Abstract
Background. Accessibility to public environment is the human right and basic need of each citizen and is one of the fundamental considerations for urban planning.

Purpose. The aim of this study is to determine the compliance of public buildings in central business districts (CBD) of Istanbul, Turkey, to wheelchair accessibility to the guidelines of the instrument and identify architectural barriers faced by wheelchair users.

Methods. This is a descriptive study of 26 public buildings in CBD of Istanbul. The instrument used is the adapted Useh, Moyo and Munyonga questionnaire to collect the data from direct observation and measurement. Descriptive statistics of simple percentages and means are used to explain the compliance to the guidelines of the instrument and wheelchair accessibility.

Results. The descriptive survey results indicate that wheelchair users experience many accessibility problems in public environment of the most urbanised city (cultural capital of Europe in 2010) in a developing country.

Conclusion. It is found that the major architectural barrier is the public transportation items with the lowest mean compliance (25%). Beside this, the most compliant to the instrument is entrance to building items with 79% as mean percentage. It is also found that there is an intention to improve accessibility when building construction period is investigated. This article describes the example of the compliance of public buildings accessibility when the country has legislation, but lacking regulations about accessibility for the wheelchair users.

### Wheelchair accessibility of public buildings: a review of the literature

#### Abstract
Purpose. The purpose of this review was to examine the wheelchair accessibility in public buildings and discuss the role of professional in this practice area.

Method. Of the 85 originally identified publications from a search of major electronic bibliographic databases, 12 studies relating to wheelchair accessibility in public buildings were selected. The compliance rates with wheelchair accessibility in different areas were summarised.

Results. No study reported 100% wheelchair accessibility despite the enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Parking had the lowest compliance rate among all facilities in terms of accessibility, while entrances had the highest.

Conclusions. A global review is needed of both new and old buildings regarding wheelchair accessibility. Professional in this practice area has an important role to play in advocating wheelchair accessibility and assisting wheelchair users to participate fully in all areas of the community.

### Disability Law in Germany: An Overview of Employment, Education and Access Rights

#### Abstract
Under German law, people with disabilities are entitled to help and assistance in order to avert, eliminate or improve their disability. The general goal is to overcome, as much as possible, the disability's effects and to enable the disabled to participate in all areas of society, especially in the labor market and in community life. The Federal Government is obliged to a barrier-free design and construction of public buildings, streets, etc. and to provide barrier-free access to communication, especially in the field of administrative Internet sites, official forms and notifications. In the area of public transportation, all facilities and means of transportation (bus, train, aircraft) are also required to be barrier-free. The same applies to restaurants.

### What about the people? Developing measures of perceived accessibility from case studies in Germany and the UK

#### Abstract
As a primary objective in transport planning urban neighbourhood accessibility plays an essential role in the sustainable transformation of cities and their infrastructure. In most studies, accessibility is objectively measured using aggregate travel time or generalised costs as an indicator of the separation of people from places. However, this approach does not reflect perceptions of residents, which ultimately shape mobility decisions and represent the “lived reality” of accessibility. This paper addresses this research gap, adding to a growing evidence base on understanding the relationship between perceived and objective measures of accessibility, and discusses opportunities for incorporating perceptions into measures of accessibility. We offer suggestions for how and why individual perceptions of accessibility differ from objective measures using data from Germany and the UK.
