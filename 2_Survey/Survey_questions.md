# Leading Questions: Definition, Characteristics and Examples

- Be aware of bias (the questions asked should not influence survey responses)

## Characteristics

    - They are intentionally framed to cultivate bias in respondents so that the answers are according to the survey creators plan.
    - The questions have an element of conjecture and assumption.
    - Leading questions thrive on a respondent’s personal input.
    - These questions are often asked to understand the consequences of a situation.
    - They tend to be forceful in terms of obtaining feedback.

## Types

    - “Share with us your experience at the sports day.” instead of “How much did you enjoy with your teachers during the sports day at school?” [avoid assumptions]
    - “Most employees hate working for more than 10 hours a day…What do you have to say about it?” instead of “Would you prefer working for fewer hours, since your current work-life balance seems to be a problem.” [interlinked statements]
    - “If you enjoyed this conference, shall we conduct another conference in a similar manner?” [consider the results that would eventually happen]
    - “Your experience with our organization was satisfactory, wasn’t it?” [forceful]
